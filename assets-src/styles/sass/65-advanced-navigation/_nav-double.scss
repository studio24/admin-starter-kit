    #Navigation advanced: double level

    There are styles for two versions of navigation here:

    - A "simple" version, where sub menus expand vertically when opened
    on smaller screens.

    - A version where sub menus have a visible "back" button to close them
     on smaller screens because when open they are absolutely positioned
     to cover their parent control.

    Make sure to comment out whichever version is not needed in your project.

    N.B. aria-expanded attribute is managed by JS
