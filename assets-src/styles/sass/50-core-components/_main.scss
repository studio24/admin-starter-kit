    #Main

    It is recommended to namespace the id used on `<main>` for your project and
    remember to use it in the `href` for the "Skip to main content" link. This
    helps distinguish from any use of `<main>` inside iframe embeds.

    1. We use left and right padding to add some minimum space between the
    contents of `<main>` and the edges of the parent element or viewport.
    To avoid making the content narrower than intended, we add an exception
    to our global box-sizing rule (defined in 30-base/_amplify-reset.scss).
